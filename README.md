# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-GNN

In this project, I use a model from deep learning which is GNN (Graph Neural Network) from Graph Convolutional Network, LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) from Convolutional Neural Network and SVM (Support Vector Machine)

Some of the model may have bad result but will be improve in the future
